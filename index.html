<p>In the time that has passed since I last posted one of these, I managed to get a prototype of scrapy to work using the new Signals <span class="caps">API</span>. This introduced two very significant API changes into&nbsp;Scrapy.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>In this report, I shall present a brief summary of the work done upto this point. To iterate, the end goal of the project is to improve the efficiency
of Scrapy’s signaling <span class="caps">API</span>. For this purpose the idea was to use Django’s signaling mechanism which claims to make the signals 90% faster. Consequently, according to plan the first step was to port <code>django.dispatch</code>, modify it to our needs and create the <code>scrapy.dispatch</code>. About a week and a half was spent on that front in first understanding the way that library is written, and what would changes needed to go into making the same work with Scrapy, and then actually making those changes. <code>django.dispatch</code> refactored much of the code of <code>PyDispatcher</code> into a <code>Signal</code> class. It also introduced a caching mechanism for receivers and introduced the <code>weakref</code> module into the&nbsp;code.    </p>

as my four years of college come to an end this year. You can check out the work that is 
documented here over on <a href="https://github.com/rootavish/">Github</a>. 
I’ve indulged quite a bit into the machine learning and data science side of things
and wish to go back to uni sometime to further my research into the area.</p>
