<p>Firstly, sorry for the extremely late blog post this time around, however I was
waiting on my mentor’s comments before I gave another status report because I
wanted his take on where we are progress wise and the status of the pull
request. So without further ado, let’s get into&nbsp;it.</p>

work that required being taken care of. Since the end of the midterm evaluations,
efforts were concentrated into taking care of issues such as compatability with the
older <span class="caps">API</span> of scrapy, unit testing and benchmarking the signal performance with the
new API and looking for places where further optimizations are&nbsp;required.</p>

<p>In the time that has passed since I last posted one of these, I managed to get a prototype of scrapy to work using the new Signals <span class="caps">API</span>. This introduced two very significant API changes into&nbsp;Scrapy.</p>

as my four years of college come to an end this year. You can check out the work that is 
documented here over on <a href="https://github.com/rootavish/">Github</a>. 
I’ve indulged quite a bit into the machine learning and data science side of things
and wish to go back to uni sometime to further my research into the area.</p>
