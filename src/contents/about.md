Hi, I'm Avishkar Gupta, a full time college student soon to be professional developer 
as my four years of college come to an end this year. You can check out the work that is 
documented here over on [Github](https://github.com/rootavish/). 
I've indulged quite a bit into the machine learning and data science side of things
and wish to go back to uni sometime to further my research into the area.
