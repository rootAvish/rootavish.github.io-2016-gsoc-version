as my four years of college come to an end this year. You can check out the work that is 
documented here over on <a href="https://github.com/rootavish/">Github</a>. 
I’ve indulged quite a bit into the machine learning and data science side of things
and wish to go back to uni sometime to further my research into the area.</p>
